# Kvlt
A black, minimal and compact theme for xfce4 to conserve screen real estate.

v0.10

This is probably not for everyone. This is optimized for my programing setup and workflow. I wanted something that conserves vertical space and gets out of the way.

The title bar is thin (14 pixels) and pure black. I there is a 1-pixel border around the windows that is black when inactive and slightly non-black when active. I enjoy using this with a black desktop background with the border as a very, very subtle highlight for the active window.

The buttons are decent, but I prefer no buttons in the window manager options and using the right-click and keyboard maps instead.

To use, copy \*.xpm and themerc files into /usr/share/theme/ into an appropriate xfwm4 directory:

 <nowiki>
$ sudo mkdir /usr/share/theme/Kvlt
$ sudo mkdir /usr/share/theme/Kvlt/xfwm4
$ sudo cp -r \*.xpm initrc /usr/share/theme/Kvlt/xfwm4
</nowiki>
