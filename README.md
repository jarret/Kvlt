# Kvlt
A black, minimal and compact theme for xfce4 to conserve screen real estate.

v0.10`

This is probably not for everyone. I wanted something that conserves vertical space and gets out of the way.

The title bar is thin (14 pixels) and pure black. I there is a 1-pixel border around the windows that is black when inactive and slightly non-black when active. I enjoy using this with a black desktop background with the border as a very, very subtle highlight for the active window.

To use, copy \*.xpm and themerc files into /usr/share/themes/ into an appropriate xfwm4 directory:

$ sudo mkdir /usr/share/themes/Kvlt

$ sudo mkdir /usr/share/themes/Kvlt/xfwm4

$ sudo cp -r \*.xpm initrc /usr/share/themes/Kvlt/xfwm4
